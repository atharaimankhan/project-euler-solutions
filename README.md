# Tajir Take-Home Assignment


## The assignment
Please create an account on Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net

Your assignment is to solve as many problems as you can by Sunday, December 19, 11:59pm. The more you solve, the better!

Once you're done, we'll review your code and decide whether or not to invite you for one final interview at our office. The final interview should take at most 1.5 hours. We will study your submission and get back to you by Monday, December 20, 11:59pm at the latest.


## Instructions
1. Create 1 file for each problem, called `problemN.py`.
2. I have already solved Problem 1, and have created an empty file for Problem 2. Please follow the pattern for the remaining problems.
3. For each problem, your code should return an answer in less than 1 minute. If your solution is slower than 1 minute, speed it up!
4. After you solve a problem, submit your answer to Project Euler to verify it's correctness.
5. After you submit your solution, create a git commit and push your code. Then move on to the next problem.


## Tips
- Use VSCode as your editor, with the Python extension.
- Feel free to create helper functions -- these can be very useful.
- It's ok to look up things like "what is the fibonacci sequence?" or "how to determine if a number is prime?". However, please do not look up "solution to problem X". This assignment is a great learning opportunity, don't waste it by taking the easy way out!
- First solve the problem, then try to simplify the code.
- The `itertools` Python package might be useful for some problems.
- After you have solved a problem, remove any extra `print` statements used for debugging.
- You can sometimes use techniques from early problems in later problems. So it's important to understand each solution before moving on to the next one.
- If you get the right answer, but don't understand why, that's bad. Make sure you understand your code fully before moving on to the next problem.


## And finally...
Good luck! We're rooting for your success :)
